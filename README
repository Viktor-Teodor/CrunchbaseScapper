This is a small script that scrapes crunchbase and linkedin for various fields and returns the data in a CSV.

For all the steps below, one must activate the python environment in venv/Scripts

The script can also be ran directly calling "python GetAllData.py" or by using the user interface.

For the user interface (which is written in Flask) one must firstly run the __init__.py script and start the flask application as per these instructions: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application
